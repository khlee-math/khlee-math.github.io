I received my PhD from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a> in 2001 and held post-doctoral positions at Seoul National University and at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University
        of Toronto</a>. In 2005, I joined the <a href="https://uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a> as an assistant professor and was promoted to full professor in 2017. 
      
My research interests are in <a href="publications/index.html#RT">representation theory</a>, <a href="publications/index.html#NT">number theory</a>, <a href="publications/index.html#CO">combinatorics</a>, <a href="publications/index.html#MP">mathematical physics</a>, and <a href="publications/index.html#ML">machine learning</a>. Recently, I have focused on applying machine learning to problems in pure mathematics. A notable outcome of this work is the discovery of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2024.2382361">murmuration</a> phenomena, and the discovery was featured in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/">Quanta Magazine</a>.

The best way to reach me is by email: <a href="mailto:khlee@math.uconn.edu">khlee@math.uconn.edu.</a> My office is located at MONT 327, and regular mail can be sent to: <a href="https://math.uconn.edu/">Department of Mathematics</a>, University of Connecticut, <a href="https://www.downtownstorrs.org/">Storrs</a>, CT 06269-1009.
