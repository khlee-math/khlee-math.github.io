I received my PhD degree in 2001 from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a>, and held post-doctoral 
        positions at Seoul National University and at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University
        of Toronto</a>. I came to the <a href="https://uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a> as an assistant professor in 2005
        and was promoted to full professor in 2017. 
      
My research interests are in <a href="publications/index.html#RT">Representation Theory</a>, <a href="publications/index.html#NT">Number Theory</a>, 
        <a href="publications/index.html#CO">Combinatorics</a> and <a href="publications/index.html#ML">Machine Learning</a>. Recently, I have been applying Machine Learning and other Data-Scientific tools to problems in pure mathematics. The discovery of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10140.pdf">Murmuration</a> phenomena is a notable result. There was a hot-topics workshop on <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/events/htw-23-ma/">Murmurations in Arithmetic</a> at ICERM in July, 2023, and the story was covered in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/">Quanta Magazine</a>.
