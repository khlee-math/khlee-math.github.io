During your tutorials the T.A. will 
discuss with you some problems from the list below. Feel free to ask questions about the problems you have difficulty with.


<br><br>

<B>Remarking Procedure</B> <BR>Your tests will be returned to 
you in the tutorial section in which you are 
registered as soon as they are marked. If you have 
any questions about the marking of your test, you will have to 
return your test to your T.A. within 10 min indicating 
on the front page which question you want to be remarked. If you 
take your paper with you, no one will look at it again. No test 
will be remarked unless the original answers were written 
in ink.

<B>Brief Description</B> <BR>This is 
the second course in Linear Algebra, that is more theoretical in 
nature then your first course (Linear Algebra I - MAT223). The 
course will cover: 
abstract vector spaces, linear mappings, linear operators on 
both real and 
complex vector spaces, inner product spaces, orthogonal 
(unitary) 
diagonalization of linear operators, isometries. It will be 
assumed that you 
know basic material from Linear Algebra I, particularly: matrix 
arithmetic, 
similarity and diagonalization of matrices and the basic 
concepts of the n-space 
R^n including orthogonality.
