<h5><b>Course Description</b></h5>
The interdisciplinary field known as Machine Learning or Data Science draws together techniques from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to extract meaning from data. In this course, we will discuss some of the essential mathematical ideas in this field.

While our focus will be on the role of Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra, we will introduce computational techniques using Python and the Jupyter notebook environment, and some ideas from statistics, in order to closely link theory and practice.

<h5><b>Course Requirements and Grading</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><b>Grading Scheme</b>: Homework --- 20%, &nbsp; 1st project --- 40%, &nbsp; 2nd project --- 40%</li>
&nbsp;
<li><b>Homework</b>: Homework will be assigned through Google Classroom.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><b>1st Project</b>: The first project is a group project with each group consisting of, preferably, three students. You may choose any dataset you want and apply any machine-learning algorithms. You present your results in class and submit the notebook and dataset to the instructor. A good resource for datasets is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. Email the instructor about your plan for the first project by February 19th. Class presentations will take place during the week of March 4th.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><b>2nd Project</b>:  The second project is also a group project. You choose any dataset and apply any <b>dimensionality reduction</b> algorithm. For example, you can apply PCA, LDA, t-SNE or UMAP. You present your results in class and submit the notebook and dataset to the instructor. It will be very important to correctly interpret your pictures during your presentation. Email the instructor about your plan for the second project by April 5th. Class presentations will begin on April 18th. </li>
</ul>
