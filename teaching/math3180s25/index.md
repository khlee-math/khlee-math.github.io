<h5><b>Course Description</b></h5>
The interdisciplinary field known as Machine Learning or Data Science draws together techniques from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to extract meaning from data. In this course, we will discuss some of the essential mathematical ideas in this field.

While our focus will be on the role of Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra, we will introduce computational techniques using Python and the Jupyter notebook environment, and some ideas from statistics, in order to closely link theory and practice.

<h5><b>Course Requirements and Grading</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><b>Grading Scheme</b>: Homework --- 20%, &nbsp; Quizzes --- 20%, &nbsp; Project --- 20%, &nbsp; 1st exam --- 20%, &nbsp; 2nd exam --- 20%</li>
&nbsp;
<li><b>Homework</b>: Homework will be assigned through Google Classroom.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><b>Quizzes</b>: A quiz will be given every Tuesday from the second week.</li>
&nbsp;
<li><b>Project</b>: You may work on a project either individually or in a group of up to three students. You are free to choose any dataset and apply any machine learning algorithms. The project requires a 10-15 minute in-class presentation of your results, along with submitting the notebook and dataset to the instructor. A great resource for datasets is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. Class presentations will begin on March 4th, with two groups presenting per class, and will continue until every student has participated. Please email the instructor with your project plan and preferred presentation date as soon as you are ready. (Dates will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.)</li>
&nbsp;
<li><b>Exams</b>: Exams will be take-home, available starting at 8:00 AM or earlier, and closing at 11:59 PM. They will be distributed through Google Classroom. The first exam will be on March 6th, and the second on May 1st. There will be no class meetings on exam days.</li>
</ul>
